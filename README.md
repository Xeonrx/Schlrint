# Schlrint
When tracing a target, confirming the school they attend to could lead to another handful of information. <br />
Use the guidance of this script to give you a hand in digging through school districts, using your targets name. <br />

With the use of a general neighborhood/city + a target name, Schlrint can scan though districts searching for attended students.
You can find a good bunch of possible school districts in a city with a simple google search. It's best to make more educated guesses
to save time.
